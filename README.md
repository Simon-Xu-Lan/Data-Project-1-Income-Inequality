# Union Income Inequality:

## The effect of labor unions on income inequality in OECD countries from 2000 - 2020.

## Interests and Intent:

- Gini coefficient (proportion of income / total population)
- What impact does union membership have on income equality within countries in the OECD?
- Is there a correlation between the volume of unions and value of currency?
- Create the summary table statistics associated with union vs. nonunion income.
- Graphical representation of the types of unions OECD, including membership quantity.
- Discover the distribution of government funding ( i.e. education, military, healthcare).
- Summarize the GDP of the countries OECD.
- How does the political environment foster or hinder union development?
- Average age of workforce?
- Diversity of workforce, including race and gender.
- Participation of labor unions over time

## Group 1: Tricia, Eli

- Gini coefficient (proportion of income / total population)Summarize the GDP of the countries OECD
- Value of currency /inequality

## Group 2: Renuka

- Average age of workforce?
- Diversity of workforce, including race and gender.

## Group 3: Anna

- Discover the distribution of government funding ( i.e. education, military, healthcare).

## Group 4: Matt, Simon

- Union participation in OECD
- Create the summary table statistics associated with union vs. nonunion income.
- What impact does union membership have on income equality within countries in the OECD? (output will rely on Union participation and gini coefficient).
- Graphical representation of the types of unions OECD, including membership quantity.
- Participation of labor unions over time

## Group 5: Bonus, Matt

- How does the political environment foster or hinder union development?
