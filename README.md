# Union Density & Economic Indicators
#### Team: Anna Kantor, Elizabeth Conway, Matthew Berry, Renuka Kafle, Simon Xu, & Tricia Harris
#### 02/06/2021 

## Key Objective & Hypothesis:
### Objective:  
- Analyze the relationship between labor union density and several important economic indicators within the countries of the OECD from 2009 - 2018.
### Core Hypothesis: 
- Countries with higher levels of union density will have lower levels of income inequality.

## Motivations
* Over the last forty years the legal and political climate in the United States has become very hostile to labor unions.
* The driving theory behind this trend is the belief among many policy makers that unions hinder economic growth.
* The primary motivation behind this project is to analyze what sort of effects union density has on various economic indicators. 

## Questions
> * What impact does union membership have on income inequality in the countries of the OECD?
> * Is there a correlation between union density and the value of a country’s currency?
> * Does the distribution of government spending have an impact on union density?
> * How does the political and legal environment within each country affect income inequality?
> * Identify the Labor Markets demographics.
> * Does Union have effects on wage gap?

## Questions: What is the relationship between union density and income inequality within the countries of the OECD?
### Data Needed:
* Information regarding “union density” in OECD countries
    * “Trade union density” expresses union membership as a proportion of the eligible workforce
* Information regarding income inequality in OECD countries
    * The Gini coefficient measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution
### Sources:
* Union Density Data Source: OECD (2021), Trade Union (database), stats.oecd.org
* Gini Coefficient Data Source: OECD (2021), Income Distribution (database), stats.oecd.org
### Analysis:
* When all of the countries of the OECD are included in the analysis there is a moderate negative correlation between union density and income inequality.

## Gini Coefficient and Union Density by Region
![Gini vs. Union by region](./images/gini_union_by_region.png)

## Latin American Outliers
- As a region, the Gini coefficient of the Latin American countries of the OECD are statistical outliers.
- When the Latin American countries are removed from the dataset the correlation coefficient between union density and Gini coefficient strengthens from -.47 to -.52, i.e. as union density increases the level of income inequality decreases.

## Questions: Is there a correlation between union density and the value of a country’s currency?
### Note: As the project progressed it appeared to us that CPI & GDP per capita are  more relevant economic measures of the effect of the union density on a country’s economy.
### Data Needed:
- Utilized data sources found with the OECD website.
### Sources:
- Data Source
  - CPI Data Source:   OECD (2021), Income distribution, OECD Social  and Welfare Statistics (database), https://doi.org/10.1787/data-00654-en
  - GDP Data Source:  OECD (2021), Gross domestic product (GDP) (indicator). doi: 10.1787/dc2f7aec-en (Accessed on 04 February 2021)


## Union Density vs CPI - all Regions
-  There appears to be no linear correlation between union density and CPI across the various regions.

## The effect of labor unions on income inequality in OECD countries from 2000 - 2020.

## Interests and Intent:

- Gini coefficient (proportion of income / total population)
- What impact does union membership have on income equality within countries in the OECD?
- Is there a correlation between the volume of unions and value of currency?
- Create the summary table statistics associated with union vs. nonunion income.
- Graphical representation of the types of unions OECD, including membership quantity.
- Discover the distribution of government funding ( i.e. education, military, healthcare).
- Summarize the GDP of the countries OECD.
- How does the political environment foster or hinder union development?
- Average age of workforce?
- Diversity of workforce, including race and gender.
- Participation of labor unions over time

## Group 1: Tricia, Eli

- Gini coefficient (proportion of income / total population)
- Summarize the GDP of the countries OECD
- Value of currency /inequality

## Group 2: Renuka

- Average age of workforce?
- Diversity of workforce, including race and gender.

## Group 3: Anna

- Discover the distribution of government funding ( i.e. education, military, healthcare).

## Group 4: Matt, Simon

- Union participation in OECD
- Create the summary table statistics associated with union vs. nonunion income.
- What impact does union membership have on income equality within countries in the OECD? (output will rely on Union participation and gini coefficient).
- Graphical representation of the types of unions OECD, including membership quantity.
- Participation of labor unions over time

## Group 5: Bonus, Matt

- How does the political environment foster or hinder union development?
